This is a full stack single page application for the public to use. A user can add different locations in the providence area, and then can add posts on different restrooms that they had visited and their experiences at that restroom. A user can dictate exactly how their experience was, even down to the smell and the cleanliness of the restroom. A user can then look at posts from other users and be able to add reviews to each individual restroom post. Also I was able to implement some back end logic where if a user tried to create a new Post of a restroom that already exists in the said location, you simply are forced to leave a review for that specific restroom. 

My ERD and Wireframe can be found in the public folder of this REPO

I used Ruby on Rails for my backend Framework and used Javascript, JQuery, HTML, and CSS in my front end. I was also able to make AJAX requests to connect to my backend.

I initially tried to implement React in my first version of this project but soon realized that in the amount of time I was allotted to finish this project there would be absolutely no way I could create something functionally because I simply did not know enough about it.
